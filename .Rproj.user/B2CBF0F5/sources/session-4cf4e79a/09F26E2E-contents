# Conclusion and Recommendation

## Conclusion
From the present study the following conclusions can be drawn-

-   Salinity can have an immediate and significant effect on the growth
    performance of *P. monodon*.

-   Different feeds and salinity-feed interaction have no significant
    effect on the growth performance of the cultured species.

-   Both feed and salinity have significant effect on the percentage
    specific growth rate (%SGR) of the cultured species. 

##	Recommendation

1.  Environmental uncertainties should be minimized during this type of
    experiment in laboratories.

2.  Further evaluation on effectiveness of microbial protein in animal
    health should be checked through unraveling their nutritional
    requirements and physiological mechanisms.
